It is made with React.js and Node.js. 
Unless deployed through firebase or such it needs to be cloned, 'npm i' and local Json launched in localhost.
Game consists of welcome screen, several game views, players storage, shop, inventory, etc. It has player stats, results and working logic.
One game is about half an hour and is turn based with decisions, inventory and shop.
Tech used so far: React.js, Node.js. Fetch to communicate with Json.db.
Known two bugs to be fixed: not 100% correct RWD and it tends during create player phase to duplicate player and forgets to load initial status. 
So far after returning to menu and removing buggy players new players loading properly from there.
